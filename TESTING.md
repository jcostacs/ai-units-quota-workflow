# Testing & Validation Report

**Workflow:** AI Units Quota Check  
**Test date:** 2026-09-23  
**Environment:** Internal sprint/hardening environment (non-production SaaS)

---

## Summary

End-to-end validation of the workflow was completed successfully in a hardening environment. All core enforcement tasks passed. Several environment-specific issues were encountered and resolved — documented below so production deployment goes smoothly.

---

## Test Approach

Since AI Units billing events are not yet available (feature is pre-GA), the DQL task was patched to inject a test user directly, and the lockout JavaScript was modified to hardcode an email address. This allowed full validation of the enforcement chain without real billing data.

**Temporary changes made for testing (do not carry into production):**

| Task | Temporary change |
|---|---|
| `check_for_ai_quota` | Replaced real DQL with `filter false` + hardcoded test email inject |
| `lock_out_users` | Replaced credential vault lookup with hardcoded `accountId` and OAuth secret |
| `lock_out_users` | Removed predecessor condition to allow unconditional execution |

All changes were reverted before committing the production `workflow.yaml`.

---

## Test Results

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `check_for_ai_quota` runs successfully with empty result | PASS | "Fail on empty result" must be OFF |
| `lock_out_users` obtains OAuth token | PASS | See hardening-specific URL note below |
| `lock_out_users` finds "AI Quota Exceeded" group via Account Management API | PASS | |
| Test user added to "AI Quota Exceeded" group | PASS | Verified in Account Management UI |
| Business event `ai.units.quota.exceeded` ingested | PASS | 3 records visible in `fetch bizevents` |
| `quota_reset_at_midnight` logic | NOT TESTED | Condition requires 00:00 UTC; validated by code review only |
| `send_email_about_ai_quota` delivery | NOT TESTED | Skipped (task was discarded due to removed condition during testing) |
| De-duplication via bizevents filterOut | NOT TESTED | Requires real billing events; validated by code review only |

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### 1. DQL does not support block comments (`/* ... */`)

**Symptom:** `check_for_ai_quota` failed with `PARSE_ERROR: ':' isn't allowed here`.  
**Cause:** The DQL query contained a `/* ... */` block comment, which the Grail parser does not support.  
**Fix:** Removed all block comments from the DQL. Single-line `//` comments within pipeline steps are supported.  
**Production impact:** The production `workflow.yaml` in this repo has no block comments — this is already fixed.

---

### 2. Hardening environment requires different OAuth and API base URLs

**Symptom:** OAuth token request returned `400 invalid_request` with empty error description.  
**Cause:** The workflow uses `sso.dynatrace.com` and `api.dynatrace.com` (production SaaS defaults), which are unreachable from the hardening environment.  
**Fix:** Swapped `tokenUrl` and `baseUrl` to the internal environment equivalents of the SSO and Account Management API endpoints.  
**Production impact:** None. The production `workflow.yaml` uses `sso.dynatrace.com` / `api.dynatrace.com`, which are correct for customer SaaS environments.

---

### 3. Outbound hosts must be in the AppEngine allowlist

**Symptom:** After correcting the URLs, requests were blocked with `NotCapable: Blocked request to '...' (host not in allowlist)`.  
**Cause:** AppEngine sandboxes outbound connections to an explicit allowlist.  
**Fix:** The hardening environment already had the sprint/hardening SSO and API hosts in its allowlist. No action was needed beyond selecting the correct URLs.  
**Production impact:** For production customer environments, `sso.dynatrace.com` and `api.dynatrace.com` should already be in the default allowlist. If a customer hits this error, they need to add those hosts via **Settings → Preferences → Allowlist for outbound connections**.

---

### 4. Credential vault `getCredentialsDetails` returned 403 in hardening

**Symptom:** `credentialVaultClient.getCredentialsDetails` returned `403: The requested credential details cannot be accessed by the current user or entity` even with correct AppEngine scope and access settings.  
**Cause:** Not fully diagnosed — likely a hardening-environment-specific restriction on credential access for AppEngine workflows. The actor authorization settings, credential scope, and access were all correctly configured.  
**Workaround:** Credentials were hardcoded directly in the script for testing purposes and removed before committing.  
**Production impact:** This 403 was not reproduced in any production SaaS environment. The production `workflow.yaml` uses the standard `getCredentialsDetails` approach (identical to the original [Log Query Quota Workflow](https://github.com/Dynatrace/community-examples/tree/main/cost-intelligence-blueprints/set-quotas-with-workflow) which works in production). Monitor this on first production deployment and escalate if the 403 reappears.

---

### 5. Workflow actor authorization settings required

**Symptom:** First execution failed with `Could not run workflow task on behalf of '<uuid>'. Please ensure Authorization Settings are configured`.  
**Cause:** The workflow Actor (service user) had not been configured in **Settings → Automations → Authorization settings**.  
**Fix:** Changed the Actor to the deploying user, who already had full authorization settings configured.  
**Production impact:** Documented in the README setup steps. The Actor must have Authorization Settings configured before the workflow can execute.

## Production Deployment Checklist

For the colleague deploying to production, verify the following before publishing:

- [ ] `event.type == "AI Units"` confirmed against production billing events (`fetch dt.system.events | filter event.kind == "BILLING_USAGE_EVENT" | dedup event.type`)
- [ ] Metric field `usage.quantity.billable` confirmed against a real AI Units billing event (see §Billing Event Schema Validation below)
- [ ] Quota threshold (default: 1,000) reviewed and adjusted for the target customer
- [ ] IAM deny policy created and attached to "AI Quota Exceeded" group (consult Dynatrace IAM docs for the appropriate permission to deny)
- [ ] OAuth client created with an Account Manager user as subject, scopes: `account-idm-read`, `account-idm-write`
- [ ] Credential vault entry `Quota check OAuth` created (Username = Account UUID, Password = full OAuth client secret, Scope = AppEngine)
- [ ] Workflow Actor has Authorization Settings configured
- [ ] `sso.dynatrace.com` and `api.dynatrace.com` are in the environment's outbound allowlist
- [ ] `send_email_about_ai_quota` tested with a real email recipient before go-live
- [ ] `quota_reset_at_midnight` validated after first production run at 00:00 UTC

## Billing Event Schema Validation

A real `AI Units` billing event was observed in an internal Dynatrace environment on 2026-09-23. The event confirmed the following field schema:

| Field | Value observed | Workflow uses |
|---|---|---|
| `event.kind` | `BILLING_USAGE_EVENT` | `filter event.kind == "BILLING_USAGE_EVENT"` ✓ |
| `event.type` | `AI Units` | `filter event.type == "AI Units"` ✓ |
| `usage.quantity.billable` | `30.00` (double) | `sum(usage.quantity.billable)` ✓ |
| `usage.unit` | `Units` | — (informational) |
| `user.email` | present (e.g. `user@dynatrace.com`) | `by:{user.email}` / `fields email = user.email` ✓ |
| `event.id` | UUID | `dedup event.id` ✓ |
| `event.version` | `1.0.0` | *(filter removed — correct, "1.0.0" ≠ "1.0")* ✓ |
| `event.provider` | `LIMA_USAGE_STREAM` | — (not filtered) |
| `dt.openpipeline.source` | `system_events` | fetched via `fetch dt.system.events` ✓ |

**Key findings:**

- `usage.quantity.billable` is confirmed as the correct metric field. The field `consumed_units` does not exist in real events.
- `event.version` is `"1.0.0"`, not `"1.0"`. Removing the `event.version == "1.0"` filter (present in the original log quota blueprint) was correct — keeping it would have caused the query to silently return no results.
- `user.email` is always present (1,463/1,463 events checked had a non-null value). Per-user quota enforcement is safe to rely on.
- `usage.start` and `usage.end` are both null in practice. The event `timestamp` is the usage time, confirming that `from: -1d@d` (since midnight UTC) is the correct timeframe for a daily quota.
- `caller.type` takes three observed values: `internal` (workflow/operator actions — the dominant type), `api` (direct API calls), and `mcp` (MCP tool calls). All share `tool.category: ai`. The workflow counts all caller types toward the quota. Customers who want to restrict the quota to specific interaction types (e.g. only `api` calls) can add `| filter caller.type == "api"` to both DQL tasks.
- Service accounts appear with a UUID-based email format (`<uuid>@service.sso.dynatrace.com`). The quota applies to these identities as well. Customers who want to exempt service accounts can add `| filterOut matchesPhrase(user.email, "@service.sso.dynatrace.com")` to both DQL tasks.
- Real-world consumption over 7 days in an active internal tenant ranged from ~51 to ~38,250 units per user. Only one user exceeded 1,000 units in a single day, validating that 1,000 units/day is a reasonable default threshold for most customer environments..
